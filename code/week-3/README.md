## Kalman Filter Example

In directory [`./kalman_filter`](./kalman_filter), a sample program for a small-scale demonstration of a Kalman filter is provided. Run the following command to test:

```
$ python testKalman.py
```

This program consists of four modules:

* `testKalman.py` is the module you want to run; it initializes a simple Kalman filter and estimates the position and velocity of an object that is assumed to move at a constant speed (but with measurement error).
* `kalman.py` implements a basic Kalman fitler as described in class.
* `plot.py` generates a plot in the format shown below.
* `data.py` provides measurement and ground truth data used in the example.

The result of running this program with test input data is illustrated below:

Interpretation of the above results is given in the lecture.

In addition, you can run `inputgen.py` to generate your own sample data. It will be interesting to experiment with a number of data sets with different characteristics (mainly in terms of variance, i.e., noise, involved in control and measurement).

## Assignment - EFK & Sensor Fusion Example

In directory [`./EKF`](./EKF), template code is provided for a simple implementation of EKF (extended Kalman filter) with sensor fusion. Run the following command to test:

```
$ python run.py
```

The program consists of five modules:

* `run.py` is the modele you want to run. It reads the input data from a text file ([data.txt](./EKF/data.txt)) and feed them to the filter; after execution summarizes the result using a 2D plot.
* `sensor_fusion.py` processees measurements by (1) adjusting the state transition matrix according to the time elapsed since the last measuremenet, and (2) setting up the process noise covariance matrix for prediction; selectively calls updated based on the measurement type (lidar or radar).
* `kalman_filter.py` implements prediction and update algorithm for EKF. All the other parts are already written, while completing `update_ekf()` is left for assignment. See below.
* `tools.py` provides a function `Jacobian()` to calculate the Jacobian matrix needed in our filter's update algorithm.
*  `plot.py` creates a 2D plot comparing the ground truth against our estimation. The following figure illustrates an example:

### Assignment

Complete the implementation of EKF with sensor fusion by writing the function `update_ekf()` in the module `kalman_filter`. Details are given in class and instructions are included in comments.
