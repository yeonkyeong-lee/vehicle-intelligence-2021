        INPUTS: A predictions dictionary with vehicle id keys and predicted
            vehicle trajectories as values. Trajectories are a list of
            Vehicle objects representing the vehicle at the current timestep
            and one timestep in the future.
        OUTPUT: The the best (lowest cost) trajectory corresponding to
            the next ego vehicle state.

        1. successor_states():
