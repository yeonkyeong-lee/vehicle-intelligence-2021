## Assignment

You will complete the implementation of a simple particle filter by writing the following two methods of `class ParticleFilter` defined in `particle_filter.py`:

* `update_weights()`: For each particle in the sample set, calculate the probability of the set of observations based on a multi-variate Gaussian distribution.
* `resample()`: Reconstruct the set of particles that capture the posterior belief distribution by drawing samples according to the weights.

To run the program (which generates a 2D plot), execute the following command:

```
$ python run.py
```

Without any modification to the code, you will see a resulting plot like the one below:

while a reasonable implementation of the above mentioned methods (assignments) will give you something like

Carefully read comments in the two method bodies and write Python code that does the job.
